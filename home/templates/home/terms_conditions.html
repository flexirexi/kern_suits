        <div class="p-4 bg-light2 text-container-fluid">
            <h5>1. Scope</h5>
            <p>
                These Terms and Conditions apply to all purchases made via our online shop at <strong>Kern Anz√ºge</strong> 
                as well as to appointments for individual tailoring services ("Design Consultation").
            </p>

            <h5>2. Orders and Conclusion of Contract</h5>
            <p>
                Your order constitutes a binding offer. The contract is concluded when we confirm the order by email. 
                We reserve the right to reject orders without stating reasons.
            </p>

            <h5>3. Payments</h5>
            <p>
                All purchases are payable in advance by credit card via Stripe. Other payment methods are not currently offered.
            </p>

            <h5>4. Delivery</h5>
            <p>
                Standard delivery times for ready-to-wear items are 5-7 business days within Germany. Delivery times may 
                vary depending on the destination country. <br>
                For individually tailored suits, production typically requires 6-8 weeks, depending on the level of customization and material 
                availability. You will be notified if additional time is necessary.
            </p>

            <h5>5. Right of Withdrawal and Returns</h5>
            <strong>Ready-to-wear products</strong>
            <p>
                Consumers have the right to withdraw from the contract within 14 days without stating any reason. The withdrawal period 
                starts from the day you receive the goods. <br>
                Returned items <strong>must be unworn, unwashed, and in their original condition.</strong> In particular, garments that 
                show signs of use (e.g., wearing at events such as weddings) or have been altered cannot be accepted. We 
                reserve the right to inspect returned items and <strong>refuse refunds if the goods are deemed used or damaged.</strong> <br>
                To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us clearly in writing(e.g., by email). You must return the 
                goods within 14 days after informing us of your withdrawal. <br>
                The cost of return shipping is borne by us. <br>
            </p>
            
            <strong>Individually tailored products</strong>
            <p>
                <strong>Custom-made suits are excluded from the right of withdrawal.</strong> Each piece is made to your specifications 
                and measurements. <br>
                Before production begins, we will conduct a detailed consultation and record all requirements in a binding 
                specification protocol. <br>
                If the delivered suit shows material or manufacturing  defects, we will remedy the issue at our expense by 
                producing a replacement. Further claims are excluded.

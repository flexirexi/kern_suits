            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
                Kern Anzüge ("Kern Suits") was founded over 20 years ago, driven by a simple ambition: to create suits that are more 
                than just clothing. From the very beginning, we set out to combine traditional tailoring with modern demands
                and to share our passion for refined menswear with our customers. <br><br>
                What started in a small workshop with only two team members has steadily grown into a company of ten
                dedicated professionals. Throughout the years, our development has always been guided by the belief that 
                craftsmanship takes time and requires an uncompromising attention to detail. <br><br>
                An essential part of our journey has also been showcasing our collections at trade fairs and international
                expos. These events allow us to present our lates designs, build relationships with carefully selected fabric 
                suppliers, and stay attuned to new trends. Without ever losing sight of our roots. In this way, we continue to 
                bring together tradition and a contemporary spirit to create suits that stand the test of time. <br><br>
                We believe a good suit is not only about the perfect fit. It is about expressing an attitude. 
                That's why we dedicate ourselves every day to making sure you feel as confident wearing it as you deserve.

            <h4>Our Master Tailors</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Fritz</strong> is one of our two exclusive master tailors. He completed 
                his training and earned his Master Craftsman qualification at the Chamber of Crafts in Stuttgart,
                one of Germany's most respected institutions for bespoke tailoring.
                His meticulous attention to detail and clear understanding of fit have shaped countless suits 
                that our customers value for their precision and comfort. <br><br>

                <strong>Alberto</strong> bring the spirit of Italian Sartoria to our workshop. He learned the art 
                of tailoring at the Scuola di Sartoria in Naples, a city renowned worldwide for its fine handmade suits. 
                His sense for fabric and proportion adds a distinctive character to our collections, blending classic 
                Italian elegance with contemporary design.
